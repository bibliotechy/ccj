# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    title: Collaborative Cataloging Japan Database Project
    text: One of the missions of CCJ is to offer access to research resources about Japanese experimental moving image. In the Database project, CCJ aims to provide a portal to existing collection information, including descriptive information about the works and the artists (on going process). Combined with the resources available on the CCJ website and other media such as essays, artist interviews, screenings, exhibitions, publication, and documentation of presentations, we carry out our "Dissemination" prong of the mission. Further, the Database documents the metadata we collect during our Collection Survey project (for internal access) that includes assessment of the preservation conditions and inventory of existing copies. This information helps us and our partners determine how to approach preservation projects. The Database Working Group comprised of experts in the field have led this project and will continue to refine it. This is the prototype of the Database, and it is a work-in-progress.
